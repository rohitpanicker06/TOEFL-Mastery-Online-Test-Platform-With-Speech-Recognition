      <h3>General Requirements for a Good TOEFL Score</h3>
      Whether you’ve already taken your TOEFL test (congratulations!) or you’re planning to take the exam, you’re likely wondering, “Will my TOEFL score be any good?” You’re not alone. Waiting the 10 days before your TOEFL results are posted online can be frustrating, but it can be even more frustrating not to know how to interpret your results!<br/>
      However, unlike most other tests we take, you can’t pass or fail the TOEFL. No TOEFL score range or individual TOEFL score can really be said to be “good” or “bad”, just as no level of English is inherently “good” or “bad”—it all depends on what kind of language you use and what you need it for. So in this post, we’ll look at a few ways to answer the question, “What is a good TOEFL score?”

      "This month-long TOEFL study plan is mostly designed to get you familiar with the TOEFL format and question types, but with the ultimate aim of getting your TOEFL scores to an acceptable level. If you’ve followed this one month TOEFL study schedule, you should be in good shape for the test!",
      <h3>30-Day TOEFL Study Plan</h3>
     This one-month TOEFL study schedule is designed for self-studiers looking to prepare for their TOEFL exam date. I highly recommend that you seek out other opportunities to practice, especially conversation with English speakers, but that is not included in the schedule because it depends on what opportunities you have.<br/>
    This month-long TOEFL study plan is mostly designed to get you familiar with the TOEFL format and question types, but with the ultimate aim of getting your TOEFL scores to an acceptable level. That means some of the material focuses on academic English in general. But if you’re concerned about your overall level of English, one month of study for the TOEFL may not be enough time. In that case, consider taking some time to get your English ability high enough beforehand, studying grammar, vocabulary, and practicing the four skills (reading, listening, speaking, and writing) outside the context of the TOEFL.<br/>
    Each week, there are 6 days of TOEFL prep. One day per week will be a rest day, which isn’t included in the schedule. Use that day to relax!<br/>
    If you have more time to devote to your studies, then buy the book Official TOEFL iBT Tests for additional practice.

      "If you are planning to study, work, or settle in an English-speaking country, you are required to qualify for an English test to prove your efficiency in the language. Even though there are a number of proficiency tests like IELTS and PTE, the type of exam you take depends on the country you wish to kickstart your career. Apart from the aforementioned exams, the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is another popular language test which is conducted by the ETS. You can take TOEFL in iBT or PBT mode where the former is  Internet-based while the latter is conducted in offline mode.<br /> <h3>What is the TOEFL exam ?</h3>The TOEFL exam is a test of English proficiency for students who plan to study in English-speaking nations. For candidates looking to study abroad in an English-speaking setting, TOEFL scores have become an important part of the application process. TOEFL requirements are frequently waived, but this is entirely at the discretion of the university authorities. TOEFL stands for Test of English as a Foreign Language, and ETS (Educational Testing Services) is in charge of administering the TOEFL exam, conducting the TOEFL iBT test, and sending each examinee their scorecard. Currently, ETS offers the ETS TOEFL iBT (Internet-Based Test), which is the most popular exam and is administered at a TOEFL test centre, TOEFL iBT Home Edition, which is the same TOEFL iBT test you would take at a test centre, but now administered from the privacy of your own home and monitored online by a human proctor, and TOEFL iBT Academic Edition. The ETS TOEFL Test on Paper is the same as the TOEFL iBT test, but it is administered in two sessions, with the Reading, Listening, and Writing sections administered at a TOEFL test centre and the Speaking section administered at home on your computer three days after the paper sections. A human proctor will monitor your Speaking session online."</p>,
